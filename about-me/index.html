title: "About Me"
---
<p>I am a student at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), where I am studying Interdisciplinary Physics with a Concentration in Computer Science. I currently plan on graduating in the summer of 2017.</p>

<p>My main interests include data handling, large systems, and in general, backend work, though I have dabbled in web design work. Other things I've done include automation, robotics, and simple circuit work.
    I am also very interested in Network Security, but have little to show for it yet. </p>

<p>I was employed at Apple, Inc as a software development intern from January, 2015 until the end of September, 2016 where I worked on automated hardware performance testing and related systems. Due to Apple's requirements, I have no open source work during this time. However, I learned a great deal about real world code and teams and am far better for it. After my employment at Apple ended (so I could focus on my classwork) I did start working on my own public projects again. Stay tuned for more.</p>
