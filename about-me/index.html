title: "About Me"
---

<p>I am a backend software engineer, currently specializing in implementation of data handling systems. I prefer to write software in SQL, Python, and Javascript (node.js, etc), though I consider myself adept at a number of other languages/systems. I greatly value coordinated teamwork and strive to not only be a good team member, but empower my team to achieve their best work.</p>

<p>My main software interests include data handling, large systems, and in general, backend work, though I have dabbled in web design and frontend work. Other things I've done include automation, robotics, and simple circuit work.</p>
<p>I am an alum of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), where I studied Interdisciplinary Physics with a Concentration in Computer Science. I graduated in the spring of 2017.</p>

<p>I am currently employed in Berlin, Germany, as a Software Engineer for <a href="https://memfault.com">Memfault</a>.</p>

<h4>Apple</h4>
<p>I was employed at Apple as a software development intern from January, 2015 until the end of September, 2016 where I worked on automated hardware performance testing and related systems. Due to Apple's requirements, I have no open source or public work during this time. However, I learned a great deal about real world software engineering and teams and am far better for it. After my employment at Apple ended (so I could focus on my classwork), I have started working on public projects again. See my <a href='{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}'>projects page</a> for some examples.</p>

<h4>Other</h4>
<p>Prior to Apple, I also worked at several other companies, from 2-person electronics shops to multi-billion dollar enterprises over several years. However, while these experiences were valuable for my early professional development, the path, skills, and technologies utilized in these roles are not in my current future plans. I avoid specifying these when possible to present an accurate picture of my current skills and goals.</p>
