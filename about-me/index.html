title: "About Me"
---
<p>I am an alum of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), where I studied Interdisciplinary Physics with a Concentration in Computer Science. I graduated in the spring of 2017.</p>

<p>My main software interests include data handling, large systems, and in general, backend work, though I have dabbled in web design work. Other things I've done include automation, robotics, and simple circuit work. I am also very interested in Network Security, but have little to show for it yet. </p>

<p>I was employed at Apple, Inc as a software development intern from January, 2015 until the end of September, 2016 where I worked on automated hardware performance testing and related systems. Due to Apple's requirements, I have no open source or public work during this time. However, I learned a great deal about real world software engineering and teams and am far better for it. After my employment at Apple ended (so I could focus on my classwork), I have started working on public projects again. See my <a href='{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}'>projects page</a> for some examples and stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contact me or procure a résumé, please use the information in any of the external sites above to do so. Reference this page to avoid getting ignored as spam. Please also note that I'm not interested in contract-only positions at this time.</p>
